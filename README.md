# My 1st app.

# Rudimentary sampple search and playback gui app, using PyimpleGUI, and PyAudio mainly.
# Trying to add precise tempo functionality.
# Wanting to maybe convert this into a M4L instance, to add direct Ableton functionality.
# Can go many different ways into development.
# the "Master" app icon has yet to be implemented.
# Cheers,
